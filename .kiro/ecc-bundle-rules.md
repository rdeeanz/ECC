# Everything Claude Code (ECC) — Agent Instructions

This is a **production-ready AI coding plugin** providing 67 specialized agents, 279 skills, 94 commands, and automated hook workflows for software development.

**Version:** 2.0.0

## Core Principles

1. **Agent-First** — Delegate to specialized agents for domain tasks
2. **Test-Driven** — Write tests before implementation, 80%+ coverage required
3. **Security-First** — Never compromise on security; validate all inputs
4. **Immutability** — Always create new objects, never mutate existing ones
5. **Plan Before Execute** — Plan complex features before writing code

## Available Agents

## Agent Orchestration

Use agents proactively without user prompt:
- Complex feature requests → **planner**
- Code just written/modified → **code-reviewer**
- Bug fix or new feature → **tdd-guide**
- Architectural decision → **architect**
- Security-sensitive code → **security-reviewer**
- Brownfield project onboarding → **spec-miner**
- Autonomous loops / loop monitoring → **loop-operator**
- Harness config reliability and cost → **harness-optimizer**

Use parallel execution for independent operations — launch multiple agents simultaneously.

## Security Guidelines

**Before ANY commit:**
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Authentication/authorization verified
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

**Secret management:** NEVER hardcode secrets. Use environment variables or a secret manager. Validate required secrets at startup. Rotate any exposed secrets immediately.

**If security issue found:** STOP → use security-reviewer agent → fix CRITICAL issues → rotate exposed secrets → review codebase for similar issues.

## Coding Style

**Immutability (CRITICAL):** Always create new objects, never mutate. Return new copies with changes applied.

**File organization:** Many small files over few large ones. 200-400 lines typical, 800 max. Organize by feature/domain, not by type. High cohesion, low coupling.

**Error handling:** Handle errors at every level. Provide user-friendly messages in UI code. Log detailed context server-side. Never silently swallow errors.

**Input validation:** Validate all user input at system boundaries. Use schema-based validation. Fail fast with clear messages. Never trust external data.

**Code quality checklist:**
- Functions small (<50 lines), files focused (<800 lines)
- No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Proper error handling, no hardcoded values
- Readable, well-named identifiers

## Testing Requirements

**Minimum coverage: 80%**

Test types (all required):
1. **Unit tests** — Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration tests** — API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E tests** — Critical user flows

**TDD workflow (mandatory):**
1. Write test first (RED) — test should FAIL
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) — test should PASS
3. Refactor (IMPROVE) — verify coverage 80%+

Troubleshoot failures: check test isolation → verify mocks → fix implementation (not tests, unless tests are wrong).

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan** — Use planner agent, identify dependencies and risks, break into phases
2. **TDD** — Use tdd-guide agent, write tests first, implement, refactor
3. **Review** — Use code-reviewer agent immediately, address CRITICAL/HIGH issues
4. **Capture knowledge in the right place**
   - Personal debugging notes, preferences, and temporary context → auto memory
   - Team/project knowledge (architecture decisions, API changes, runbooks) → the project's existing docs structure
   - If the current task already produces the relevant docs or code comments, do not duplicate the same information elsewhere
   - If there is no obvious project doc location, ask before creating a new top-level file
5. **Commit** — Conventional commits format, comprehensive PR summaries

## Workflow Surface Policy

- `skills/` is the canonical workflow surface.
- New workflow contributions should land in `skills/` first.
- `commands/` is a legacy slash-entry compatibility surface and should only be added or updated when a shim is still required for migration or cross-harness parity.

## Git Workflow

**Commit format:** `<type>: <description>` — Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

**PR workflow:** Analyze full commit history → draft comprehensive summary → include test plan → push with `-u` flag.

## Architecture Patterns

**API response format:** Consistent envelope with success indicator, data payload, error message, and pagination metadata.

**Repository pattern:** Encapsulate data access behind standard interface (findAll, findById, create, update, delete). Business logic depends on abstract interface, not storage mechanism.

**Skeleton projects:** Search for battle-tested templates, evaluate with parallel agents (security, extensibility, relevance), clone best match, iterate within proven structure.

## Performance

**Context management:** Avoid last 20% of context window for large refactoring and multi-file features. Lower-sensitivity tasks (single edits, docs, simple fixes) tolerate higher utilization.

**Build troubleshooting:** Use build-error-resolver agent → analyze errors → fix incrementally → verify after each fix.

## Project Structure

```
agents/          — 67 specialized subagents
skills/          — 279 workflow skills and domain knowledge
commands/        — 94 slash commands
hooks/           — Trigger-based automations
rules/           — Always-follow guidelines (common + per-language)
scripts/         — Cross-platform Node.js utilities
mcp-configs/     — 14 MCP server configurations
tests/           — Test suite
```

`commands/` remains in the repo for compatibility, but the long-term direction is skills-first.

## Success Metrics

- All tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- Performance is acceptable
- User requirements are met

# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## Core Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple)

- Prefer the simplest solution that actually works
- Avoid premature optimization
- Optimize for clarity over cleverness

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or utilities
- Avoid copy-paste implementation drift
- Introduce abstractions when repetition is real, not speculative

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Do not build features or abstractions before they are needed
- Avoid speculative generality
- Start simple, then refactor when the pressure is real

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Naming Conventions

- Variables and functions: `camelCase` with descriptive names
- Booleans: prefer `is`, `has`, `should`, or `can` prefixes
- Interfaces, types, and components: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Custom hooks: `camelCase` with a `use` prefix

## Code Smells to Avoid

### Deep Nesting

Prefer early returns over nested conditionals once the logic starts stacking.

### Magic Numbers

Use named constants for meaningful thresholds, delays, and limits.

### Long Functions

Split large functions into focused pieces with clear responsibilities.

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

Sumber: https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC/blob/main/rules/common/testing.md

# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (framework chosen per language)

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Agent Support

- **tdd-guide** - Use PROACTIVELY for new features, enforces write-tests-first

## Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

Prefer Arrange-Act-Assert structure for tests:

```typescript
test('calculates similarity correctly', () => {
  // Arrange
  const vector1 = [1, 0, 0]
  const vector2 = [0, 1, 0]

  // Act
  const similarity = calculateCosineSimilarity(vector1, vector2)

  // Assert
  expect(similarity).toBe(0)
})
```

### Test Naming

Use descriptive names that explain the behavior under test:

```typescript
test('returns empty array when no markets match query', () => {})
test('throws error when API key is missing', () => {})
test('falls back to substring search when Redis is unavailable', () => {})
```

# Development Workflow

> This file extends [common/git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) with the full feature development process that happens before git operations.

The Feature Implementation Workflow describes the development pipeline: research, planning, TDD, code review, and then committing to git.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

0. **Research & Reuse** _(mandatory before any new implementation)_
   - **GitHub code search first:** Run `gh search repos` and `gh search code` to find existing implementations, templates, and patterns before writing anything new.
   - **Library docs second:** Use Context7 or primary vendor docs to confirm API behavior, package usage, and version-specific details before implementing.
   - **Exa only when the first two are insufficient:** Use Exa for broader web research or discovery after GitHub search and primary docs.
   - **Check package registries:** Search npm, PyPI, crates.io, and other registries before writing utility code. Prefer battle-tested libraries over hand-rolled solutions.
   - **Search for adaptable implementations:** Look for open-source projects that solve 80%+ of the problem and can be forked, ported, or wrapped.
   - Prefer adopting or porting a proven approach over writing net-new code when it meets the requirement.

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Generate planning docs before coding: PRD, architecture, system_design, tech_doc, task_list
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - See [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) for commit message format and PR process

5. **Pre-Review Checks**
   - Verify all automated checks (CI/CD) are passing
   - Resolve any merge conflicts
   - Ensure branch is up to date with target branch
   - Only request review after these checks pass

# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Note: To disable co-author attribution on commits, set `"includeCoAuthoredBy": false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code appends `Co-Authored-By` by default; ECC does not ship this setting).

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## FILE: rules/common/patterns.md
Sumber: https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC/blob/main/rules/common/patterns.md

# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Use parallel agents to evaluate options:
   - Security assessment
   - Extensibility analysis
   - Relevance scoring
   - Implementation planning
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Define standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Concrete implementations handle storage details (database, API, file, etc.)
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not the storage mechanism
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing with mocks

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for all API responses:
- Include a success/status indicator
- Include the data payload (nullable on error)
- Include an error message field (nullable on success)
- Include metadata for paginated responses (total, page, limit)

# Performance Optimization

## Model Selection Strategy

**Haiku** (90% of Sonnet capability, 3x cost savings):
- Lightweight agents with frequent invocation
- Pair programming and code generation
- Worker agents in multi-agent systems

**Sonnet** (Best coding model):
- Main development work
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Complex coding tasks

**Opus** (Deepest reasoning):
- Complex architectural decisions
- Maximum reasoning requirements
- Research and analysis tasks

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

Lower context sensitivity tasks:
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Extended Thinking + Plan Mode

Extended thinking is enabled by default, reserving up to 31,999 tokens for internal reasoning.

Control extended thinking via:
- **Toggle**: Option+T (macOS) / Alt+T (Windows/Linux)
- **Config**: Set `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Budget cap**: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000` (bash) or `$env:MAX_THINKING_TOKENS = "10000"` (PowerShell)
- **Verbose mode**: Ctrl+O to see thinking output

For complex tasks requiring deep reasoning:
1. Ensure extended thinking is enabled (on by default)
2. Enable **Plan Mode** for structured approach
3. Use multiple critique rounds for thorough analysis
4. Use split role sub-agents for diverse perspectives

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix

# Code Review Standards

## Purpose

Code review ensures quality, security, and maintainability before code is merged. This rule defines when and how to conduct code reviews.

## When to Review

**MANDATORY review triggers:**

- After writing or modifying code
- Before any commit to shared branches
- When security-sensitive code is changed (auth, payments, user data)
- When architectural changes are made
- Before merging pull requests

**Pre-Review Requirements:**

Before requesting review, ensure:

- All automated checks (CI/CD) are passing
- Merge conflicts are resolved
- Branch is up to date with target branch

## Review Checklist

Before marking code complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are focused (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are cohesive (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Errors are handled explicitly
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] Tests exist for new functionality
- [ ] Test coverage meets 80% minimum

## Security Review Triggers

**STOP and use security-reviewer agent when:**

- Authentication or authorization code
- User input handling
- Database queries
- File system operations
- External API calls
- Cryptographic operations
- Payment or financial code

## Review Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | **BLOCK** - Must fix before merge |
| HIGH | Bug or significant quality issue | **WARN** - Should fix before merge |
| MEDIUM | Maintainability concern | **INFO** - Consider fixing |
| LOW | Style or minor suggestion | **NOTE** - Optional |

## Agent Usage

Use these agents for code review:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **code-reviewer** | General code quality, patterns, best practices |
| **security-reviewer** | Security vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10 |
| **typescript-reviewer** | TypeScript/JavaScript specific issues |
| **python-reviewer** | Python specific issues |
| **go-reviewer** | Go specific issues |
| **rust-reviewer** | Rust specific issues |

## Review Workflow

```
1. Run git diff to understand changes
2. Check security checklist first
3. Review code quality checklist
4. Run relevant tests
5. Verify coverage >= 80%
6. Use appropriate agent for detailed review
```

## Common Issues to Catch

### Security

- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- SQL injection (string concatenation in queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped user input)
- Path traversal (unsanitized file paths)
- CSRF protection missing
- Authentication bypasses

### Code Quality

- Large functions (>50 lines) - split into smaller
- Large files (>800 lines) - extract modules
- Deep nesting (>4 levels) - use early returns
- Missing error handling - handle explicitly
- Mutation patterns - prefer immutable operations
- Missing tests - add test coverage

### Performance

- N+1 queries - use JOINs or batching
- Missing pagination - add LIMIT to queries
- Unbounded queries - add constraints
- Missing caching - cache expensive operations

## Approval Criteria

- **Approve**: No CRITICAL or HIGH issues
- **Warning**: Only HIGH issues (merge with caution)
- **Block**: CRITICAL issues found

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works with:

- [testing.md](testing.md) - Test coverage requirements
- [security.md](security.md) - Security checklist
- [git-workflow.md](git-workflow.md) - Commit standards
- [agents.md](agents.md) - Agent delegation

# Web Coding Style

## File Organization

Organize by feature or surface area, not by file type:

```text
src/
├── components/
│   ├── hero/
│   │   ├── Hero.tsx
│   │   ├── HeroVisual.tsx
│   │   └── hero.css
│   ├── scrolly-section/
│   │   ├── ScrollySection.tsx
│   │   ├── StickyVisual.tsx
│   │   └── scrolly.css
│   └── ui/
│       ├── Button.tsx
│       ├── SurfaceCard.tsx
│       └── AnimatedText.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── useReducedMotion.ts
│   └── useScrollProgress.ts
├── lib/
│   ├── animation.ts
│   └── color.ts
└── styles/
    ├── tokens.css
    ├── typography.css
    └── global.css
```

## CSS Custom Properties

Define design tokens as variables. Do not hardcode palette, typography, or spacing repeatedly:

```css
:root {
  --color-surface: oklch(98% 0 0);
  --color-text: oklch(18% 0 0);
  --color-accent: oklch(68% 0.21 250);

  --text-base: clamp(1rem, 0.92rem + 0.4vw, 1.125rem);
  --text-hero: clamp(3rem, 1rem + 7vw, 8rem);

  --space-section: clamp(4rem, 3rem + 5vw, 10rem);

  --duration-fast: 150ms;
  --duration-normal: 300ms;
  --ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
```

## Animation-Only Properties

Prefer compositor-friendly motion:
- `transform`
- `opacity`
- `clip-path`
- `filter` (sparingly)

Avoid animating layout-bound properties:
- `width`
- `height`
- `top`
- `left`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `border`
- `font-size`

## Semantic HTML First

```html
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">...</nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section aria-labelledby="hero-heading">
    <h1 id="hero-heading">...</h1>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>...</footer>
```

Do not reach for generic wrapper `div` stacks when a semantic element exists.

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`ScrollySection`, `SurfaceCard`)
- Hooks: `use` prefix (`useReducedMotion`)
- CSS classes: kebab-case or utility classes
- Animation timelines: camelCase with intent (`heroRevealTl`)

# Web Design Quality Standards

## Anti-Template Policy

Do not ship generic template-looking UI. Frontend output should look intentional, opinionated, and specific to the product.

### Banned Patterns

- Default card grids with uniform spacing and no hierarchy
- Stock hero section with centered headline, gradient blob, and generic CTA
- Unmodified library defaults passed off as finished design
- Flat layouts with no layering, depth, or motion
- Uniform radius, spacing, and shadows across every component
- Safe gray-on-white styling with one decorative accent color
- Dashboard-by-numbers layouts with sidebar + cards + charts and no point of view
- Default font stacks used without a deliberate reason

### Required Qualities

Every meaningful frontend surface should demonstrate at least four of these:

1. Clear hierarchy through scale contrast
2. Intentional rhythm in spacing, not uniform padding everywhere
3. Depth or layering through overlap, shadows, surfaces, or motion
4. Typography with character and a real pairing strategy
5. Color used semantically, not just decoratively
6. Hover, focus, and active states that feel designed
7. Grid-breaking editorial or bento composition where appropriate
8. Texture, grain, or atmosphere when it fits the visual direction
9. Motion that clarifies flow instead of distracting from it
10. Data visualization treated as part of the design system, not an afterthought

## Before Writing Frontend Code

1. Pick a specific style direction. Avoid vague defaults like "clean minimal".
2. Define a palette intentionally.
3. Choose typography deliberately.
4. Gather at least a small set of real references.
5. Use ECC design/frontend skills where relevant.

## Worthwhile Style Directions

- Editorial / magazine
- Neo-brutalism
- Glassmorphism with real depth
- Dark luxury or light luxury with disciplined contrast
- Bento layouts
- Scrollytelling
- 3D integration
- Swiss / International
- Retro-futurism

Do not default to dark mode automatically. Choose the visual direction the product actually wants.

## Component Checklist

- [ ] Does it avoid looking like a default Tailwind or shadcn template?
- [ ] Does it have intentional hover/focus/active states?
- [ ] Does it use hierarchy rather than uniform emphasis?
- [ ] Would this look believable in a real product screenshot?
- [ ] If it supports both themes, do both light and dark feel intentional?

# Web Security Rules

## Content Security Policy

Always configure a production CSP.

### Nonce-Based CSP

Use a per-request nonce for scripts instead of `'unsafe-inline'`.

```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-{RANDOM}' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://*.example.com;
  frame-src 'none';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
```

Adjust origins to the project. Do not cargo-cult this block unchanged.

## XSS Prevention

- Never inject unsanitized HTML
- Avoid `innerHTML` / `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized first
- Escape dynamic template values
- Sanitize user HTML with a vetted local sanitizer when absolutely necessary

## Third-Party Scripts

- Load asynchronously
- Use SRI when serving from a CDN
- Audit quarterly
- Prefer self-hosting for critical dependencies when practical

## HTTPS and Headers

```text
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## Forms

- CSRF protection on state-changing forms
- Rate limiting on submission endpoints
- Validate client and server side
- Prefer honeypots or light anti-abuse controls over heavy-handed CAPTCHA defaults

# Web Performance Rules

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LCP | < 2.5s |
| INP | < 200ms |
| CLS | < 0.1 |
| FCP | < 1.5s |
| TBT | < 200ms |

## Bundle Budget

| Page Type | JS Budget (gzipped) | CSS Budget |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Landing page | < 150kb | < 30kb |
| App page | < 300kb | < 50kb |
| Microsite | < 80kb | < 15kb |

## Loading Strategy

1. Inline critical above-the-fold CSS where justified
2. Preload the hero image and primary font only
3. Defer non-critical CSS or JS
4. Dynamically import heavy libraries

```js
const gsapModule = await import('gsap');
const { ScrollTrigger } = await import('gsap/ScrollTrigger');
```

## Image Optimization

- Explicit `width` and `height`
- `loading="eager"` plus `fetchpriority="high"` for hero media only
- `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold assets
- Prefer AVIF or WebP with fallbacks
- Never ship source images far beyond rendered size

## Font Loading

- Max two font families unless there is a clear exception
- `font-display: swap`
- Subset where possible
- Preload only the truly critical weight/style

## Animation Performance

- Animate compositor-friendly properties only
- Use `will-change` narrowly and remove it when done
- Prefer CSS for simple transitions
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` or established animation libraries for JS motion
- Avoid scroll handler churn; use IntersectionObserver or well-behaved libraries

## Performance Checklist

- [ ] All images have explicit dimensions
- [ ] No accidental render-blocking resources
- [ ] No layout shifts from dynamic content
- [ ] Motion stays on compositor-friendly properties
- [ ] Third-party scripts load async/defer and only when needed

# Web Testing Rules

## Priority Order

### 1. Visual Regression

- Screenshot key breakpoints: 320, 768, 1024, 1440
- Test hero sections, scrollytelling sections, and meaningful states
- Use Playwright screenshots for visual-heavy work
- If both themes exist, test both

### 2. Accessibility

- Run automated accessibility checks
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify reduced-motion behavior
- Verify color contrast

### 3. Performance

- Run Lighthouse or equivalent against meaningful pages
- Keep CWV targets from [performance.md](performance.md)

### 4. Cross-Browser

- Minimum: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test scrolling, motion, and fallback behavior

### 5. Responsive

- Test 320, 375, 768, 1024, 1440, 1920
- Verify no overflow
- Verify touch interactions

## E2E Shape

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('landing hero loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toBeVisible();
});
```

- Avoid flaky timeout-based assertions
- Prefer deterministic waits

## Unit Tests

- Test utilities, data transforms, and custom hooks
- For highly visual components, visual regression often carries more signal than brittle markup assertions
- Visual regression supplements coverage targets; it does not replace them

# Web Patterns

## Component Composition

### Compound Components

Use compound components when related UI shares state and interaction semantics:

```tsx
<Tabs defaultValue="overview">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="overview">Overview</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="settings">Settings</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content value="overview">...</Tabs.Content>
  <Tabs.Content value="settings">...</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs>
```

- Parent owns state
- Children consume via context
- Prefer this over prop drilling for complex widgets

### Render Props / Slots

- Use render props or slot patterns when behavior is shared but markup must vary
- Keep keyboard handling, ARIA, and focus logic in the headless layer

### Container / Presentational Split

- Container components own data loading and side effects
- Presentational components receive props and render UI
- Presentational components should stay pure

## State Management

Treat these separately:

| Concern | Tooling |
|---------|---------|
| Server state | TanStack Query, SWR, tRPC |
| Client state | Zustand, Jotai, signals |
| URL state | search params, route segments |
| Form state | React Hook Form or equivalent |

- Do not duplicate server state into client stores
- Derive values instead of storing redundant computed state

## URL As State

Persist shareable state in the URL:
- filters
- sort order
- pagination
- active tab
- search query

## Data Fetching

### Stale-While-Revalidate

- Return cached data immediately
- Revalidate in the background
- Prefer existing libraries instead of rolling this by hand

### Optimistic Updates

- Snapshot current state
- Apply optimistic update
- Roll back on failure
- Emit visible error feedback when rolling back

### Parallel Loading

- Fetch independent data in parallel
- Avoid parent-child request waterfalls
- Prefetch likely next routes or states when justified

# TypeScript/JavaScript Coding Style

> This file extends [common/coding-style.md](../common/coding-style.md) with TypeScript/JavaScript specific content.

## Types and Interfaces

Use types to make public APIs, shared models, and component props explicit, readable, and reusable.

### Public APIs

- Add parameter and return types to exported functions, shared utilities, and public class methods
- Let TypeScript infer obvious local variable types
- Extract repeated inline object shapes into named types or interfaces

```typescript
// WRONG: Exported function without explicit types
export function formatUser(user) {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}

// CORRECT: Explicit types on public APIs
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

export function formatUser(user: User): string {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}
```

### Interfaces vs. Type Aliases

- Use `interface` for object shapes that may be extended or implemented
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, tuples, mapped types, and utility types
- Prefer string literal unions over `enum` unless an `enum` is required for interoperability

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

type UserRole = 'admin' | 'member'
type UserWithRole = User & {
  role: UserRole
}
```

### Avoid `any`

- Avoid `any` in application code
- Use `unknown` for external or untrusted input, then narrow it safely
- Use generics when a value's type depends on the caller

```typescript
// WRONG: any removes type safety
function getErrorMessage(error: any) {
  return error.message
}

// CORRECT: unknown forces safe narrowing
function getErrorMessage(error: unknown): string {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return error.message
  }

  return 'Unexpected error'
}
```

### React Props

- Define component props with a named `interface` or `type`
- Type callback props explicitly
- Do not use `React.FC` unless there is a specific reason to do so

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

interface UserCardProps {
  user: User
  onSelect: (id: string) => void
}

function UserCard({ user, onSelect }: UserCardProps) {
  return <button onClick={() => onSelect(user.id)}>{user.email}</button>
}
```

### JavaScript Files

- In `.js` and `.jsx` files, use JSDoc when types improve clarity and a TypeScript migration is not practical
- Keep JSDoc aligned with runtime behavior

```javascript
/**
 * @param {{ firstName: string, lastName: string }} user
 * @returns {string}
 */
export function formatUser(user) {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}
```

## Immutability

Use spread operator for immutable updates:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
}

// WRONG: Mutation
function updateUser(user: User, name: string): User {
  user.name = name // MUTATION!
  return user
}

// CORRECT: Immutability
function updateUser(user: Readonly<User>, name: string): User {
  return {
    ...user,
    name
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Use async/await with try-catch and narrow unknown errors safely:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  email: string
}

declare function riskyOperation(userId: string): Promise<User>

function getErrorMessage(error: unknown): string {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return error.message
  }

  return 'Unexpected error'
}

const logger = {
  error: (message: string, error: unknown) => {
    // Replace with your production logger (for example, pino or winston).
  }
}

async function loadUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {
  try {
    const result = await riskyOperation(userId)
    return result
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    logger.error('Operation failed', error)
    throw new Error(getErrorMessage(error))
  }
}
```

## Input Validation

Use Zod for schema-based validation and infer types from the schema:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'

const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150)
})

type UserInput = z.infer<typeof userSchema>

const validated: UserInput = userSchema.parse(input)
```

## Console.log

- No `console.log` statements in production code
- Use proper logging libraries instead
- See hooks for automatic detection

# TypeScript/JavaScript Patterns

> This file extends [common/patterns.md](../common/patterns.md) with TypeScript/JavaScript specific content.

## API Response Format

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean
  data?: T
  error?: string
  meta?: {
    total: number
    page: number
    limit: number
  }
}
```

## Custom Hooks Pattern

```typescript
export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState<T>(value)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => setDebouncedValue(value), delay)
    return () => clearTimeout(handler)
  }, [value, delay])

  return debouncedValue
}
```

## Repository Pattern

```typescript
interface Repository<T> {
  findAll(filters?: Filters): Promise<T[]>
  findById(id: string): Promise<T | null>
  create(data: CreateDto): Promise<T>
  update(id: string, data: UpdateDto): Promise<T>
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>
}

# React Coding Style

> This file extends [typescript/coding-style.md](../typescript/coding-style.md) and [common/coding-style.md](../common/coding-style.md) with React specific content.

## File Extensions

- `.tsx` for any file containing JSX, even one-liner snippets
- `.ts` for pure logic, custom hooks without JSX, type definitions, utilities
- `.test.tsx` / `.test.ts` mirroring the source file
- Use `.jsx` only when the project intentionally avoids TypeScript — flag every new untyped React file in review

## Naming

- Components: `PascalCase` for both the symbol and the file (`UserCard.tsx`, default export `UserCard`)
- Custom hooks: `useCamelCase` for the symbol, kebab-case for the file when the project convention is kebab-case (`use-debounce.ts` exports `useDebounce`)
- Context: `<Domain>Context` symbol, `<Domain>Provider` provider component, `use<Domain>` consumer hook
- Event handlers: `handleClick`, `handleSubmit` inside the component; the prop that receives it is `onClick`, `onSubmit`
- Boolean props: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit` — never `loading` or `error` alone for booleans

## Component Shape

```tsx
type Props = {
  user: User;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
};

export function UserCard({ user, onSelect }: Props) {
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => onSelect(user.id)}>
      {user.name}
    </button>
  );
}
```

- Prefer `type Props = {}` for closed component prop shapes
- Use `interface` only when the prop type is extended via declaration merging or exported as a public API extension point
- Always destructure props in the parameter list — no `props.user` access inside the body
- Type the return implicitly through JSX (`function Foo(): JSX.Element` only when the function returns conditionally and the union confuses inference)

## JSX

- Self-close tags with no children: `<img />`, `<UserCard user={u} />`
- Use fragments `<>...</>` over wrapper `<div>` when no DOM element is needed
- Conditional rendering: `{condition && <Foo />}` for booleans, ternary for either/or, early return for guard clauses
- Never put logic inline in JSX when it reads as multi-line — extract to a const above the return or a function

```tsx
// Prefer
const greeting = user.isAdmin ? "Welcome, admin" : `Hello ${user.name}`;
return <h1>{greeting}</h1>;

// Over
return <h1>{user.isAdmin ? "Welcome, admin" : `Hello ${user.name}`}</h1>;
```

## Server / Client Boundary (Next.js App Router, RSC)

- Default a new file to Server Component — only add `"use client"` when the file uses state, effects, refs, browser APIs, or event handlers
- Place the `"use client"` directive on line 1, before any imports
- Never import a Client Component file from inside a `"use server"` action file
- Never re-export server-only code through a client module — the bundler will silently include it

## Imports

- React imports first: `import { useState } from "react"`
- Then third-party libs, then absolute project imports, then relative
- Type-only imports: `import type { ReactNode } from "react"` — never mix runtime and type imports in one statement when ESLint's `consistent-type-imports` is configured

## Hooks Discipline

See [hooks.md](./hooks.md) for the full ruleset. Style highlights:

- Custom hooks must start with `use` — enforced by `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
- Group all hook calls at the top of the component, before any conditional logic
- Avoid creating ad-hoc hooks for one-line wrappers — inline the call instead

## State

- Local first (`useState`), lift only when shared
- Context for cross-cutting state read by many components (theme, auth, i18n) — not for high-frequency updates
- External store (Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit) when state must persist across route changes, sync across tabs, or be debugged via devtools
- Never duplicate state that can be derived — compute during render

## Class Components

Forbidden in new code. Convert legacy class components to function components when touching them for non-trivial changes.

## File Layout per Component

```
components/UserCard/
  UserCard.tsx
  UserCard.module.css   # or styled-components, or Tailwind classes inline
  UserCard.test.tsx
  index.ts              # re-export only
```

Inline single-file components are fine for trivial presentational pieces.

# React Security

> This file extends [typescript/security.md](../typescript/security.md) and [common/security.md](../common/security.md) with React specific content.

## XSS via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

CRITICAL. The prop name is deliberately scary — treat every usage as a code review halt.

```tsx
// CRITICAL: unsanitized user input
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userBio }} />

// CORRECT options:
// 1. Render as text
<div>{userBio}</div>

// 2. Render parsed markdown via a library that sanitizes
<ReactMarkdown>{userBio}</ReactMarkdown>

// 3. If raw HTML is required, sanitize first with DOMPurify
import DOMPurify from "isomorphic-dompurify";
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(userBio) }} />
```

Audit checklist for every `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` call:

- Is the input always under our control? Document the source.
- If user-derived: is it sanitized at the **same call site**? (Sanitization at the API boundary is acceptable only if every consumer is verified.)
- Is the sanitizer config allowlisting tags, not denylisting?

## Unsafe URL Schemes

`javascript:` and `data:` URLs in `href`, `src`, and `xlink:href` execute arbitrary code.

```tsx
// CRITICAL: javascript: URL injection
<a href={user.website}>Visit</a>   // if user.website = "javascript:alert(1)"

// CORRECT: validate scheme
function safeUrl(url: string): string | undefined {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    if (["http:", "https:", "mailto:"].includes(parsed.protocol)) return url;
  } catch {
    return undefined;
  }
  return undefined;
}
<a href={safeUrl(user.website)}>Visit</a>
```

React warns about `javascript:` URLs in `href` in development mode, but does not block them at runtime. `data:` URLs and other schemes also slip through. Always validate.

## `target="_blank"` Without `rel`

`<a target="_blank">` without `rel="noopener noreferrer"` lets the target page access `window.opener` and run navigation hijacks.

```tsx
// WRONG
<a href={externalUrl} target="_blank">External</a>

// CORRECT
<a href={externalUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">External</a>
```

Modern browsers default to `noopener` when `target="_blank"`, but do not rely on browser defaults — be explicit.

## Server Action Input Validation

Server Actions (`"use server"`) run with the same trust level as a public API endpoint. Validate every input.

```tsx
"use server";
import { z } from "zod";

const Input = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(120),
});

export async function updateUser(_state: unknown, formData: FormData) {
  const parsed = Input.safeParse({
    email: formData.get("email"),
    age: Number(formData.get("age")),
  });
  if (!parsed.success) return { error: parsed.error.flatten() };
  // ...
}
```

- Authenticate inside the action — do not trust the client-side route gate
- Authorize: confirm the current user has permission for the specific record they are mutating
- Rate limit sensitive actions

## Secret Exposure via Env Vars

Prefixed env vars are bundled into the client. Treat them as public.

| Framework | Public prefix | Private |
|---|---|---|
| Next.js | `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` | All others |
| Vite | `VITE_*` | `.env` server-side only |
| Create React App | `REACT_APP_*`, plus `NODE_ENV` and `PUBLIC_URL` | All others (anything without the `REACT_APP_` prefix is server-side only) |
| Remix | `process.env` access in `loader`/`action` only | Same |

```ts
// CRITICAL: secret leaked to client bundle
const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY;
```

Audit on every PR that touches env vars: would this string in the public bundle be a problem?

## Authentication / Authorization

- Never store sessions in `localStorage` — accessible to any XSS. Use httpOnly secure cookies.
- Never trust client-set state to gate sensitive UI. Render-gating in JSX prevents display, not access — the API must enforce.
- CSRF: cookie-based auth requires CSRF tokens or `SameSite=Strict`/`Lax` cookies
- Use double-submit cookies or origin verification for form actions when not using framework defaults

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

Configure server-side. The minimum acceptable CSP for a React app:

```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{REQUEST_NONCE}';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' data: https:;
connect-src 'self' https://api.example.com;
frame-ancestors 'none';
```

- Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` in `script-src`
- For SSR with inline scripts (Next.js streaming, hydration data), use per-request nonces — both Next.js and Remix support nonce injection
- `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is often unavoidable for CSS-in-JS libraries — document the tradeoff

## Prototype Pollution via Object Spread

```tsx
// WRONG: untrusted JSON spread directly into state
const update = await req.json();
setState({ ...state, ...update });    // attacker controls __proto__

// CORRECT: parse with a schema, or guard keys
const Allowed = z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string().email() });
const parsed = Allowed.parse(await req.json());
setState({ ...state, ...parsed });
```

## SSR Template Injection

When using `renderToString` or `renderToPipeableStream`:

- All values rendered inside JSX are escaped by React — safe
- Values passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` are NOT escaped — same rules as client
- Manually constructed HTML wrappers around the React output must be escaped or sanitized — never concatenate user input into the surrounding HTML template

## Third-Party Components

- Audit `npm audit` before adding any UI library
- Check that the library does not internally use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on its input (e.g., rich text editors)
- Pin versions, review changelogs before major upgrades
- Be wary of components that accept HTML strings as props

## Source Map Exposure in Production

Production builds should ship without source maps, or with sourcemaps uploaded to an error tracker (Sentry) and stripped from the public bundle. Public source maps leak internal logic and file structure.

## Agent Support

- Use `security-reviewer` agent for comprehensive security audits across the codebase
- Use `react-reviewer` agent for React-specific patterns and the above rules in active code review

# React Testing

> This file extends [typescript/testing.md](../typescript/testing.md) and [common/testing.md](../common/testing.md) with React specific content.

## Library Choice

- **React Testing Library (RTL)** — the standard for component testing. Tests behavior through the rendered DOM.
- **Vitest** — preferred runner for new Vite-based projects. Faster than Jest, native ESM, same API.
- **Jest** — still the default for Next.js / CRA projects. RTL works identically.
- **Playwright Component Testing** — when component tests need a real browser engine (animation, layout, complex events)
- **Cypress Component Testing** — alternative real-browser component runner

Pick one component test runner per project — do not mix RTL + Playwright CT in the same repo.

## Core Principle

Test what the user sees and does, not implementation details.

- Query by accessible role first, then label, then text — fall back to `data-testid` only when nothing else fits
- Never assert on internal state, props passed to children, or which hooks were called
- Refactor without breaking tests = the test was testing behavior; that is the goal

## Query Priority

RTL exposes queries in three families. Use this priority order top-down:

1. **Accessible to everyone**
   - `getByRole(role, { name })` — primary choice
   - `getByLabelText` — for form inputs
   - `getByPlaceholderText` — when no label is available (and add a label)
   - `getByText` — for non-interactive text
   - `getByDisplayValue` — for form fields with a current value

2. **Semantic queries**
   - `getByAltText` — for images
   - `getByTitle` — last resort, low accessibility value

3. **Test IDs**
   - `getByTestId("some-id")` — escape hatch only, when none of the above work

`getBy*` throws when no match. `queryBy*` returns null (use for asserting absence). `findBy*` returns a promise (use for async).

## User Interaction

Prefer `userEvent` over `fireEvent`. `userEvent` simulates real browser sequences (focus, keydown, beforeinput, input, keyup) — `fireEvent` dispatches a single synthetic event.

```tsx
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";

test("submits the form", async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  render(<UserForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);

  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText("Email"), "user@example.com");
  await user.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: /save/i }));

  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ email: "user@example.com" });
});
```

- Always `await` `userEvent` calls — they are async
- Call `userEvent.setup()` once at the top of each test, then reuse the returned `user`

## Async Assertions

```tsx
// WRONG: synchronous query for async-rendered content
expect(screen.getByText("Loaded")).toBeInTheDocument();   // throws — not in DOM yet

// CORRECT: findBy* (returns a promise, retries)
expect(await screen.findByText("Loaded")).toBeInTheDocument();

// CORRECT: waitFor for non-element assertions
await waitFor(() => expect(saveSpy).toHaveBeenCalled());
```

- `findBy*` for async element appearance
- `waitFor` for async expectations on side effects or other matchers
- Never `setTimeout` + assertion — flaky

## Network Mocking with MSW

Use Mock Service Worker for any test that hits a network boundary. MSW runs at the network layer, so the component, hooks, and fetch library all behave as in production.

```tsx
// test setup
import { setupServer } from "msw/node";
import { http, HttpResponse } from "msw";

const server = setupServer(
  http.get("/api/users/:id", ({ params }) =>
    HttpResponse.json({ id: params.id, name: "Alice" }),
  ),
);

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

Per-test override:

```tsx
test("renders error on 500", async () => {
  server.use(http.get("/api/users/:id", () => new HttpResponse(null, { status: 500 })));
  render(<UserPage id="1" />);
  expect(await screen.findByText(/something went wrong/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Avoid Snapshot Tests for Components

Snapshots of rendered output are brittle, hard to review, and rubber-stamped by reviewers. Use them only for:

- Pure data serialization (e.g., a transformer that produces a stable string)
- Catching unintended regressions in non-visual output

For component visual regression, use Playwright / Cypress / Percy screenshots — actual visual diffs, not DOM diffs.

## Test Setup Helpers

Wrap providers once:

```tsx
function renderWithProviders(ui: React.ReactElement) {
  return render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={new QueryClient()}>
      <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
        <Router>{ui}</Router>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>,
  );
}
```

Export from `test-utils.tsx` and use everywhere.

## Custom Hook Testing

Use `renderHook` from RTL:

```tsx
import { renderHook, act } from "@testing-library/react";

test("useCounter increments", () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());
  act(() => result.current.increment());
  expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
});
```

- Always wrap state-changing calls in `act`
- Always test through the public hook API, not internal implementation

## Accessibility Assertions

```tsx
import { axe } from "vitest-axe";   // or jest-axe

test("UserCard has no a11y violations", async () => {
  const { container } = render(<UserCard user={mockUser} />);
  expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

Run axe assertions in component tests — catches missing labels, ARIA misuse, color contrast (limited).

## When to Reach for Playwright / Cypress

Component test with RTL + JSDOM cannot:

- Test real layout (flexbox, grid, viewport-dependent rendering)
- Test scrolling, drag-and-drop, paste from clipboard
- Test browser-native animation, CSS transitions
- Test cross-frame interactions (iframes, popups)

For those, use Playwright Component Testing or end-to-end Playwright/Cypress runs. See [e2e-testing skill](../../skills/e2e-testing/SKILL.md).

## Coverage Targets

| Layer | Target |
|---|---|
| Pure utility functions | ≥90% |
| Custom hooks | ≥85% |
| Components (presentational) | ≥80% — behavior, not lines |
| Container components | ≥70% — golden paths + error states |
| Pages (E2E covered separately) | Smoke test per route minimum |

## Anti-Patterns

- Asserting on `container.querySelector` — bypasses accessibility queries
- Asserting on number of renders — implementation detail
- Mocking React hooks (`jest.mock("react", ...)`) — refactor the component instead
- Mocking child components by default — tests the integration, not the parent in isolation
- Manual `act()` warnings ignored — they indicate real bugs

# React Patterns

> This file extends [typescript/patterns.md](../typescript/patterns.md) and [common/patterns.md](../common/patterns.md) with React specific content. For hook-specific rules see [hooks.md](./hooks.md).

## Container / Presentational Split

Container components own data fetching, state, and side effects. Presentational components receive props and render — no service calls, no hooks beyond local UI state.

```tsx
// Container — owns data
export function UserPage({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const { data: user, isLoading } = useUser(userId);
  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
  if (!user) return <NotFound />;
  return <UserCard user={user} onSelect={handleSelect} />;
}

// Presentational — pure
export function UserCard({ user, onSelect }: { user: User; onSelect: (id: string) => void }) {
  return <button onClick={() => onSelect(user.id)}>{user.name}</button>;
}
```

## State Location Decision Tree

1. Used by one component → `useState` inside it
2. Used by parent + a few children → lift to nearest common ancestor, pass via props
3. Used across distant branches → React Context **for low-frequency reads only** (theme, auth, locale)
4. High-frequency updates shared across the tree → external store (Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit)
5. Server-derived data → server-state library (TanStack Query, SWR, RSC fetch) — not application state

Context misused for frequently changing values causes every consumer to re-render on every update.

## Server / Client Component Boundary (RSC, Next.js App Router)

- Server Components are the default — they run on the server, do not ship to the client, and can `await` directly
- Client Components opt in with `"use client"` at the top of the file
- Data flows down: a Server Component can render a Client Component and pass serializable props
- A Client Component cannot import a Server Component, but it can receive one via `children` or named slots

```tsx
// Server (default)
export default async function Page() {
  const user = await fetchUser();
  return <UserClient user={user} />;
}

// Client
"use client";
export function UserClient({ user }: { user: User }) {
  const [tab, setTab] = useState("profile");
  return <Tabs value={tab} onChange={setTab}>{user.name}</Tabs>;
}
```

- Never import `"server-only"` packages (DB clients, secrets) from a Client Component file — wrap them in a Server Component or Server Action
- Mark sensitive modules with `import "server-only"` so the bundler errors if a client file imports them

## Suspense + Error Boundaries

Every Suspense boundary needs an Error Boundary above it. The pair handles both states.

```tsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorView />}>
  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
    <UserDetails id={id} />
  </Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

- Place Suspense boundaries close to where data is needed, not at the route root
- Multiple narrower boundaries reveal loaded content progressively
- Error Boundary must be a Class Component (React 19 has no functional equivalent yet) OR use a library wrapper such as `react-error-boundary`

## Forms

### Uncontrolled (React 19 + form actions)

Prefer uncontrolled inputs with form actions when the form has a clear submit step. The browser owns the value; React reads it via `FormData` on submit.

```tsx
async function action(formData: FormData) {
  "use server";
  await saveUser({ name: String(formData.get("name")) });
}

export function UserForm() {
  return (
    <form action={action}>
      <input name="name" required />
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Controlled

Use controlled inputs when the value drives other UI, requires real-time validation, or formatting.

```tsx
const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
return <input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />;
```

### Form Libraries

For complex forms (multi-step, dynamic field arrays, cross-field validation), use a library:

- React Hook Form — minimal re-renders, uncontrolled-first
- TanStack Form — typed, framework-agnostic
- Final Form — when subscription-based re-renders matter

## Data Fetching

| Strategy | When |
|---|---|
| RSC fetch (`await` in Server Component) | Per-request data in Next.js App Router, no client-side cache needed |
| TanStack Query | Client-side cache, mutations, optimistic updates, polling |
| SWR | Lightweight cache + revalidation, simpler than TanStack Query |
| `fetch` in `useEffect` | Avoid — race conditions, no cache, no retry. Only acceptable for one-off fire-and-forget |

Never fetch in a `useEffect` when a real cache library is available — they handle deduping, cache invalidation, error retry, and Suspense integration.

## Lists and Keys

- `key` must be stable across renders — never `index` for any list that can reorder, insert, or delete
- `key` must be unique among siblings, not globally
- A reordered list with index keys causes state in child components to attach to the wrong row

## Composition over Inheritance

- Pass `children` for slot-style composition
- Pass render-prop functions for parameterized rendering
- Pass component types for plug-in points: `renderItem={UserRow}`
- Never extend a component class to specialize behavior

## Compound Components

For related controls (Tabs, Accordion, Menu), use compound components sharing state via Context:

```tsx
<Tabs defaultValue="profile">
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="profile">Profile</Tabs.Trigger>
    <Tabs.Trigger value="settings">Settings</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panel value="profile"><ProfileForm /></Tabs.Panel>
  <Tabs.Panel value="settings"><SettingsForm /></Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs>
```

## Portals

Use `createPortal` for modals, tooltips, toast containers — anything that must escape the parent's `overflow: hidden` or `z-index` stacking context. Render to a stable DOM node mounted in `index.html`.

## Refs and Forwarding (React 19+)

React 19 lets function components accept `ref` as a regular prop — `forwardRef` is no longer required.

```tsx
export function Input({ ref, ...rest }: { ref?: React.Ref<HTMLInputElement> } & InputProps) {
  return <input ref={ref} {...rest} />;
}
```

Older codebases on React 18 still need `forwardRef`.

## Out of Scope (Pointer Sections)

### Next.js (App Router)

- Server Actions, Route Handlers, Middleware, Parallel/Intercepted Routes, streaming Metadata
- Treated as a separate framework concern — when adding deep Next-specific patterns, propose a dedicated `rules/nextjs/` track
- For now follow Next.js official docs for App Router specifics

### React Native

- Platform-specific imports (`Platform.OS`, `.ios.tsx` / `.android.tsx`), `StyleSheet`, navigation libraries (React Navigation, Expo Router)
- Treated as a separate track — `rules/react-native/` is not yet present
- React core hooks/patterns from this file still apply
